## FortiManagement Infrastructure (FortiGate / FortiManager / FortiAnalyzer) on Azure

A Terraform script to deploy FortiManager and FortiAnalyzer protected by a single FortiGate-VM on Azure  

## Introduction
FortiGate topology
* port1 - public/untrust with public IP
* port2 - private/trust

FortiManager
FortiAnalyzer
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS Jumphost

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider AzureRM >= 2.24.0
* Terraform Provider Template >= 2.2.0
* Terraform Provider Random >= 3.1.0

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:

* Azure Virtual Network with 4 subnets - external, internal, 2x workload subnets
* 1x FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with two NICs.  
* Untrust interface placed in SD-WAN zone "Underlay".
* 7x firewall rules / VIPs - permit outbound, permit internal, permit FMG TCP 4444 --> 443, TCP 541 --> 541, permit FAZ TCP 4444 --> 443, TCP 514 --> 514, UDP 514 -- 514
* Azure SDN connector using managed identity with reader.
* FortiManager VM in the first workload subnet. Note: license files cannot be slipstreamed into custom_data, a license (or trial registration) is required on first login. 
* FortiAnalyzer VM in the first workload subnet. Note: license files cannot be slipstreamed into custom_data, a license (or trial registration) is required on first login.
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS test client VM in the first workload subnet.
* UDRs for internal subnet routing table for default routing and inter-subnet routing through FortiGate.
* Choose PAYG or BYOL in variables - if BYOL, place .lic files in subfolder "licenses" and define in variables.
* Terraform backend (versions.tf) stored in Azure storage - customise backend.conf to suit or modify as appropriate. An backend.conf.example is provided or comment out the backend "azurerm" resource block.

Topology using default variables

**If BYOL is used, then some policies cannot be created in FortiOS due to the limitation of unlicensed VM only allowing 3 policies. Add the remaining policies/VIPs after creation. Default routing and port 443 access to FMG/FAZ has been deliberately placed first.**

## Deployment

To deploy the FortiGate-VM to Azure:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Customize variables defined in `variables.tf` file as needed with a standard *.auto.tfvars file. An example is provided.
3. Initialize the providers defining the backend (terraform init -backend-config=backend.conf) and run terraform as normal.

Outputs:

- PublicIP = <Cluster Public IP>
- FortiGate Username = <FGT admin>
- FortiGate Password = <FGT Password>
- FMG/FAZ Username = <FMG/FAZ admin>
- FMG/FAZ Password = <FMG/FAZ Password>
- ResourceGroup = <Resource Group>
- VNET_CIDR = <vnet summary route>

Azure credentials:

The following code is commented out in provider.tf that can be uncommented to run via a service principal

- subscription_id = var.subscription_id
- client_id       = var.client_id
- client_certificate_path   = var.client_certificate_path
- tenant_id       = var.tenant_id

The client_id and client_certificate_path variables are only required for this purpose.

## Acknowledgements
This template was developed from the starting point of https://github.com/fortinet/fortigate-terraform-deploy/tree/main/azure/7.2/ha-port1-mgmt-crosszone-3ports and then enhanced with managed identity SDN connector etc.
